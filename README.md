# Coding Problems Statement:
## Hello Readers this is a repository for coding problems in java.

## (A). Math 
 1. Take Input as Integer from user and check for Prime Number.
    
        example :- 
                Input: 5
                Output: "This is a Prime Number"
    #### Solution Link :  [PrimeNumber](https://github.com/PuShPaK-kUmAr/Java-Code/blob/master/src/Math/PrimeNumber.java)

## (B). String
1. Take Input as String from user and write code to reverse the string.

        example :- 
                Input: "hello"
                Output: "olleh"
   #### Solution Link :  [ReverseString](https://github.com/PuShPaK-kUmAr/Java-Code/blob/master/src/String/ReverseString.java)
2. Take Input as Sentence of String from user and write code to reverse the Sentence.

        example :- 
                Input: "hello from jack"
                Output: "jack from hello"
   #### Solution Link :  [ReverseSentence](https://github.com/PuShPaK-kUmAr/Java-Code/blob/master/src/String/ReverseSentence.java)
3. Take Input as String from user and write code to remove the repeated character from the string.

        example :- 
                Input: "Hello World"
                Output: "Helo Wrd"
